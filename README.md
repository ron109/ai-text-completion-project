# AI Text Completion Project

This project demonstrates a simple AI-powered text completion application using a pre-trained language model from Hugging Face.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following Python libraries:
- `transformers` — for accessing pre-trained models
- `torch` — for running the model (automatically installed in Colab)

These are pre-installed in Google Colab. If running locally, install them via:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
